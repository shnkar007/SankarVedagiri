SCOPED VALUES
  This JEP introduces scoped values that enable sharing of immutable data within and across threads. They are alternatives to thread locals that can be combined
  with virtual threads. They allow storing values for a limited time that allow only the threads that write the data to read. They are created as public static fields
  so that they can be retrieved from any method without programmatically
