SCOPED VALUES
  This JEP introduces scoped values that enable sharing of immutable data within and across threads. They are alternatives to thread locals that can be combined
  with virtual threads. They allow storing values for a limited time that allow only the threads that write the data to read. They are created as public static fields
  so that they can be retrieved from any method without programmatically passing them as parameters to those methods. If multiple threads use the same scoped values  
  field, the values will have the different values with a different point of view of each thread. 
  Advantages of scoped values are, they allow data to be safely and efficiently shared between components without passing as arguments to methods. Scoped Values have
  multiple incarnations tied to each thread. In this process when it is used in scope of a particular thread, the scoped values variable has value specific to that 
  thread and its visibility is limited to that, we can say that they are bound to that thread. It is immutable and is available only for a bounded period during the 
  execution period of the thread.
   ScopedValue is shows as below
      final static ScopedValue<T> scopedValue = ScopedValue.newInstance();
      It is used in the methods like below:
        ScopedValue.where(scopedValue,<value>).run(()->{.... scopedValue.get() .... call some methods, perform some actions});
  
    The syntax clearly depicts the bounded nature of the value and the data transmission is unidirectional and immutable. The scope of each usage is bound to a 
    particular thread.

  There are a few flaws with the thread local variables:
   Unconstrained Mutability:
      
   
   Unbounded Lifetime
   
   Expensive inheritance
