JEP 432 Record Patterns 
 A record pattern consists of type, record component pattern list used to match against the corresponding record patterns.
 For example, in the following declaration
   record Point(int i, int j){},
   a value v matches the record pattern Point(int i, int j) if it is an instance of the record type Point. If it is an instance, i is initialized with the result
   of invoking the accessor method corresponding to i on v and j is initialized with result of invoking the accessor method corresponding to j on v. Null value does 
   not match any record pattern.
