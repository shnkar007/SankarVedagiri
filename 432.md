JEP 432 Record Patterns 

 A record pattern is a construct that allows us to match values against a record type and bind variables to corresponding components of the record.
 An optional identifier can also be given which makes it a named record pattern and allows us to refer to the record pattern variable.
 A record pattern consists of type, record component pattern list used to match against the corresponding record patterns.
 For example, in the following declaration
   record Point(int i, int j){},
   a value v matches the record pattern Point(int i, int j) if it is an instance of the record type Point. If it is an instance, i is initialized with the result
   of invoking the accessor method corresponding to i on v and j is initialized with result of invoking the accessor method corresponding to j on v. Null value does 
   not match any record pattern. var can be used by a record pattern to match against any record pattern without stating the type of the component. In case the compiler infers to the type of the variable introduced by var.
